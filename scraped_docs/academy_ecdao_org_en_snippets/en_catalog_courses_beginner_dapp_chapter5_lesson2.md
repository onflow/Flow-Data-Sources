# Chapter 5 Lesson 2 - Deploying our DApp

In our last lesson (weâre almost there!), weâre going to be deploying our DApp to Vercel so everyone can see our DApp and interact with it.

## Vercel

What is Vercel? Well, itâs basically magic. It allows you to select a GitHub repository and automatically deploy it for free so that it lives at a real URL, and then people can interact with it.

> *Important #1*: Delete the `.eslintrc.json` file in your project.

> *Important #2*: Before you go on, make sure you have pushed your latest code to your GitHub repository. To remember how to do this, go back to the bottom of Chapter 2 Lesson 1.

> Go to <https://vercel.com/> and create an account

Then, go to your profile screen that looks like this:

![](/courses/beginner-dapp/select-deployment.png)
> Find the repository that says âbeginner-emerald-dappâ and press âImportâ.

> Then press âDeployâ.

Wait a few minutes and make sure there are no errors. If there are, reach out in the Emerald Academy chat in the [Emerald City Discord](https://discord.gg/wjA875sMjV).

Then, you should be able to go to your deployed project on Vercel and find the URL where your project is deployed.
