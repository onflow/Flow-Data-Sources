Hello World

# Hello World


Quickstart

Unity

Change and read a greeting field on Flow Testnet.



## ð© Quickstart 0: Hello Flow UnitySDK

Learn to deploy a simple Greetings contract to learn the basics of the Flow blockchain, Cadence and Flow Unity SDK. Weâll use:

* Flow CLI (Testnet)
* Unity
* Flow Unity SDK
* Editor of your choice (VS Code is preffered)

We will be making a Unity project that will allow us to create a new greeting, modify it and display it.

## ð¦ Checkpoint 0: Install

sh
```
		
			git clone https://github.com/memxor/FlowGreetingsUnity.git
		 
	
```

Next, open the project using Unity (recommended 2022.3.8f1) and run the project by clicking the play button in the Unity editor.

## ð Checkpoint 1: Log In

In order to log in with a wallet, you will have to scan the QR code.

## ð Checkpoint 2: Reading the Greeting

Next, lets read the greeting that is currently on Flow testnet. To do this, click the âRead Greetingâ button.

## âï¸ Checkpoint 3: Changing the Greeting

Now lets run a transaction which will modify the data in our smart contract. In order to do this, input a new greeting where it says âEnter a New Greetingâ and click âSubmitâ. This will initialize a transaction that will take a few seconds.

## ð Checkpoint 4: Reading the Updated Greeting

Now that we have updated our greeting, click the âRead Greetingâ button again and confirm that the greeting has actually been changed.
