| Flow is home to numerous AAA web3 platforms, including Disney Pinnacle, Barbie Boss Beauties, NFL AllDay, and NBA Top Shot. Since announcing seamless support with EVM late last year, Flow has seen a rapid influx of EVM-based builders launching new projects every day. With thousands of smart contracts serving over 36 million user accounts, Flow continues to grow its builder community through partnerships, hackathons, and technical leadership.  The Flow Builder Perks is a new initiative that provides startups, hackathon participants, and verified builders with exclusive benefits from top technology partners. Inspired by programs like the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack), [AWS Activate](https://aws.amazon.com/activate/), [Google for Startups](https://startup.google.com/), and [Superteam Member Perks](https://superteam.fun/member-perks), its launch will initially offer a highly curated list of 10 perks designed to help projects launch and scale quickly. These include access to cloud computing and LLM API credits, hosting services, developer tooling and more.  By connecting to the Flow Developers Portal and authenticating through GitHub, qualified builders will gain easy, barrier-free access to valuable tools and services. This streamlined program equips teams early in their project lifecycle with the resources they need to learn, integrate partner technologies, and innovate without unnecessary hurdles.  Comment below on the perks you would love to see included in this initiative! |
