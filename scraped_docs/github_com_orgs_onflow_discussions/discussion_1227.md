| Would love to see a discord faucet similar to what other chains do. Increases community engagement and it's simple. |

| Correct. The Kovan on Ethereum has a similar thing. See: <https://gitter.im/kovan-testnet/faucet?at=5dd685a4c4fca14de3c3be4a> |

| Ahhh that would be awesome! If we had the ability to mint flow token I could easily incorporate into emerald bot, but we would need flow team’s approval |
