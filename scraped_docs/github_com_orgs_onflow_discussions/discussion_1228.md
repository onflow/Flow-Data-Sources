| Hey hey, I saw on Twitter that the VSCode Extension was fixed for Windows. However it is still broken for me. Contracts do not get imported correctly because the extension is having trouble with local file paths. |

| Hey Jacob, the fixes have not been released yet. Not sure who mentioned on Twitter that it was fixed. Still in the testing phase, but we plan on doing a release early next week!  You can check out the progress here: [#201](https://github.com/onflow/vscode-cadence/issues/201) |
