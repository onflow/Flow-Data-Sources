# Constants and Variable Declarations

Constants and variables are declarations that bind
a value and [type](/docs/language/type-safety) to an identifier.
Constants are initialized with a value and cannot be reassigned afterwards.
Variables are initialized with a value and can be reassigned later.
Declarations can be created in any scope, including the global scope.

Constant means that the *identifier's* association is constant,
not the *value* itself â€“
the value may still be changed if it is mutable.

Constants are declared using the `let` keyword. Variables are declared
using the `var` keyword.
The keywords are followed by the identifier,
an optional [type annotation](/docs/language/type-annotations), an equals sign `=`,
and the initial value.

 `_15// Declare a constant named `a`._15//_15let a = 1_15_15// Invalid: re-assigning to a constant._15//_15a = 2_15_15// Declare a variable named `b`._15//_15var b = 3_15_15// Assign a new value to the variable named `b`._15//_15b = 4`

Variables and constants **must** be initialized.

 `_10// Invalid: the constant has no initial value._10//_10let a`

The names of the variable or constant
declarations in each scope must be unique.
Declaring another variable or constant with a name that is already
declared in the current scope is invalid, regardless of kind or type.

 `_23// Declare a constant named `a`._23//_23let a = 1_23_23// Invalid: cannot re-declare a constant with name `a`,_23// as it is already used in this scope._23//_23let a = 2_23_23// Declare a variable named `b`._23//_23var b = 3_23_23// Invalid: cannot re-declare a variable with name `b`,_23// as it is already used in this scope._23//_23var b = 4_23_23// Invalid: cannot declare a variable with the name `a`,_23// as it is already used in this scope,_23// and it is declared as a constant._23//_23var a = 5`

However, variables can be redeclared in sub-scopes.

 `_13// Declare a constant named `a`._13//_13let a = 1_13_13if true {_13 // Declare a constant with the same name `a`._13 // This is valid because it is in a sub-scope._13 // This variable is not visible to the outer scope._13_13 let a = 2_13}_13_13// `a` is `1``

A variable cannot be used as its own initial value.

 `_10// Invalid: Use of variable in its own initial value._10let a = a`[Edit this page](https://github.com/onflow/cadence-lang.org/tree/main/docs/language/constants-and-variables.md)[PreviousSyntax](/docs/language/syntax)[NextType Annotations](/docs/language/type-annotations)Got suggestions for this site?
