The Flow VM bridge is the account and series of smart contracts that manage how
assets are safely bridged between the Cadence and EVM Flow Environments.

| Network | Contract Address |
| --- | --- |
| Emulator | `0xf8d6e0586b0a20c7` |
| Cadence Testing Framework | `0x0000000000000001` |
| Testnet | `0xdfc20aee650fcbdf` |
| Mainnet | `0x1e4aa0b87d10b141` |

# Contracts

There are many important contracts deployed to the bridge account.
You should refer to [the bridge repo](https://github.com/onflow/flow-evm-bridge)
and [the bridge guides](/tutorials/cross-vm-apps/vm-bridge)
for more detailed information about the bridge and tutorials for how to use the bridge properly.

Here is a list of each Cadence contract used for the bridge:

| Contract | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `CrossVMNFT` | Contract defining cross-VM NFT-related interfaces |
| `CrossVMToken` | Contract defining cross-VM Fungible Token Vault interface |
| `FlowEVMBridgeHandlerInterfaces` | Defines interface for custom bridged token handlers |
| `IBridgePermissions` | Defines an interface to prevent bridging for a specific token |
| `ICrossVM` | Defines an interface to get EVM contract addresses |
| `ICrossVMAsset` | Defines an interface to represent a Cadence bridged version of an EVM asset |
| `IEVMBridgeNFTMinter` | Defines an interface that allows the bridge to mint NFTs |
| `IEVMBridgeTokenMinter` | Defines an interface that allows the bridge to mint FTs |
| `IFlowEVMNFTBridge` | Defines core methods for bridging NFTs |
| `IFlowEVMTokenBridge` | Defines core methods for bridging FTs |
| `FlowEVMBridge` | The main entrypoint for briding tokens across Flow VMs |
| `FlowEVMBridgeAccessor` | Defines methods to route bridge requests from the EVM contract to the Flow-EVM bridge contract |
| `FlowEVMBridgeConfig` | Used to store configuration options for the VM Bridge |
| `FlowEVMBridgeCustomAssociations` | Stores configuration information about custom bridged asset configurations |
| `FlowEVMBridgeCustomAssociationTypes` | Defines interfaces used to specify custom bridged asset associations |
| `FlowEVMBridgeHandlers` | Defines mechanisms for handling assets with custom associations (Deprecated) |
| `FlowEVMBridgeNFTEscrow` | Handles locking of NFTs that are bridged from Flow to EVM and back |
| `FlowEVMBridgeResolver` | Defines methods to resolve Metadata Views for bridged assets |
| `FlowEVMBridgeTemplates` | Serves Cadence code from chunked templates for bridge-deployed assets |
| `FlowEVMBridgeTokenEscrow` | Handles locking of FTs that are bridged from Flow to EVM and back |
| `FlowEVMBridgeUtils` | Defines many different utility methods that are used by bridge contracts |
| `ArrayUtils` | Provides useful utility functions for manipulating arrays |
| `ScopedFTProviders` | Provides utilities for creating provider capabilities for tokens that are restricted to a specific amount |
| `Serialize` | Provides utilities for serializing common types to json-compatible strings |
| `SerializeMetadata` | Provides methods for serializing NFT metadata as a JSON compatible string |
| `StringUtils` | Provides useful utility functions for manipulating strings |

# EVM Bridge Solidity Contracts

There are also Solidity contracts that are deployed in Flow EVM that are needed for the bridge.
Here are their addresses:

| Contracts | Testnet | Mainnet |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FlowEVMBridgeFactory.sol` | [`0xf8146b4aef631853f0eb98dbe28706d029e52c52`](https://evm-testnet.flowscan.io/address/0xF8146B4aEF631853F0eB98DBE28706d029e52c52) | [`0x1c6dea788ee774cf15bcd3d7a07ede892ef0be40`](https://evm.flowscan.io/address/0x1C6dEa788Ee774CF15bCd3d7A07ede892ef0bE40) |
| `FlowEVMBridgeDeploymentRegistry.sol` | [`0x8781d15904d7e161f421400571dea24cc0db6938`](https://evm-testnet.flowscan.io/address/0x8781d15904d7e161f421400571dea24cc0db6938) | [`0x8fdec2058535a2cb25c2f8cec65e8e0d0691f7b0`](https://evm.flowscan.io/address/0x8FDEc2058535A2Cb25C2f8ceC65e8e0D0691f7B0) |
| `FlowEVMBridgedERC20Deployer.sol` | [`0x4d45CaD104A71D19991DE3489ddC5C7B284cf263`](https://evm-testnet.flowscan.io/address/0x4d45CaD104A71D19991DE3489ddC5C7B284cf263) | [`0x49631Eac7e67c417D036a4d114AD9359c93491e7`](https://evm.flowscan.io/address/0x49631Eac7e67c417D036a4d114AD9359c93491e7) |
| `FlowEVMBridgedERC721Deployer.sol` | [`0x1B852d242F9c4C4E9Bb91115276f659D1D1f7c56`](https://evm-testnet.flowscan.io/address/0x1B852d242F9c4C4E9Bb91115276f659D1D1f7c56) | [`0xe7c2B80a9de81340AE375B3a53940E9aeEAd79Df`](https://evm.flowscan.io/address/0xe7c2B80a9de81340AE375B3a53940E9aeEAd79Df) |

And below are the bridge escrow's EVM addresses. These addresses are [`CadenceOwnedAccount`s (COA)](https://developers.flow.com/tutorials/cross-vm-apps/interacting-with-coa#coa-interface) and they are stored stored in the same Flow account as you'll find the Cadence contracts (see above).

| Network | Address |
| --- | --- |
| Testnet | [`0x0000000000000000000000023f946ffbc8829bfd`](https://evm-testnet.flowscan.io/address/0x0000000000000000000000023f946FFbc8829BFD) |
| Mainnet | [`0x00000000000000000000000249250a5c27ecab3b`](https://evm.flowscan.io/address/0x00000000000000000000000249250a5C27Ecab3B) |
