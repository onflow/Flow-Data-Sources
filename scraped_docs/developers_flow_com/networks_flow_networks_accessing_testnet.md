# Flow Testnet

## About Flow Testnet[‚Äã](#about-flow-testnet "Direct link to About Flow Testnet")

Flow Testnet is Flow's official testing and development network. It is intended to provide a staging and testing environment for dApp developers.
It aims to balance similarity with Mainnet with being a productive development environment, resulting in the following key differences:

* Testnet has significantly fewer validator nodes, resulting in a faster block rate compared to Mainnet
* Testnet is configured with shorter epochs (about 12 hours, compared to 7 days on Mainnet)
* Testnet receives software upgrades up to 2 weeks before Mainnet

## Accessing Flow Testnet[‚Äã](#accessing-flow-testnet "Direct link to Accessing Flow Testnet")

Flow Testnet is available for access at this URL:

`_10

access.devnet.nodes.onflow.org:9000`

For example, to access the network using the [Flow Go SDK](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk):

`_10

import "github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk/client"

_10

_10

func main() {

_10

flowAccessAddress := "access.devnet.nodes.onflow.org:9000"

_10

flowClient, _ := client.New(flowAccessAddress, grpc.WithInsecure())

_10

// ...

_10

}`

### Generating Testnet Key Pair[‚Äã](#generating-testnet-key-pair "Direct link to Generating Testnet Key Pair")

You can generate a new key pair with the [Flow CLI](https://github.com/onflow/flow-cli) as follows:

`_10

> flow keys generate

_10

_10

üôè If you want to create an account on Testnet with the generated keys use this link:

_10

https://testnet-faucet.onflow.org/?key= cc1c3d72...

_10

_10

_10

üî¥Ô∏è Store private key safely and don't share with anyone!

_10

Private Key 246256f3...

_10

Public Key cc1c3d72...`

**Note: By default, this command generates an ECDSA key pair on the P-256 curve. Keep in mind, the CLI is intended for development purposes only and is not recommended for production use. Handling keys using a Key Management Service is the best practice.**

## Account Creation and Token Funding Requests[‚Äã](#account-creation-and-token-funding-requests "Direct link to Account Creation and Token Funding Requests")

Accounts and tokens for testing can be obtained through the [testnet faucet](https://testnet-faucet.onflow.org/). If you generated the keypair through the CLI, you can click on the URL provided to create an account and request testnet FLOW tokens.

## Important Smart Contract Addresses[‚Äã](#important-smart-contract-addresses "Direct link to Important Smart Contract Addresses")

You can review [all available core contracts](/build/core-contracts) deployed to the Testnet to identify which ones you want to import.
