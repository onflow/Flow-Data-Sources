# Cadence Linter

The Cadence Linter is a static-analysis tool for finding potential issues in Cadence code. It is available in the Flow CLI & is designed to help developers write better code by identifying common mistakes and potential issues before they become problems.

The linter will also check your code for any syntax or semantic errors, and provide suggestions for how to fix them.
