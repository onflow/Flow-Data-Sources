# Start Emulator

The Flow Emulator is a lightweight development tool that mimics the behavior of the real Flow network. It is bundled with the [Flow CLI](https://docs.onflow.org/flow-cli/), which makes starting and configuring the emulator straightforward.

## Initial Configuration[‚Äã](#initial-configuration "Direct link to Initial Configuration")

The emulator requires a configuration file (`flow.json`). If you don‚Äôt already have one, create it using the `flow init` command:

`_10

flow init`

This initializes a default configuration file that the emulator will use.

## Starting the Emulator[‚Äã](#starting-the-emulator "Direct link to Starting the Emulator")

To start the emulator with default settings, use the following command:

`_10

flow emulator`

This will start the emulator with the configuration defined in `flow.json`.

### Example Output[‚Äã](#example-output "Direct link to Example Output")

When you run the `flow emulator` command, you will see output similar to the following:

`_10

INFO[0000] ‚öôÔ∏è Using service account 0xf8d6e0586b0a20c7 serviceAddress=f8d6e0586b0a20c7 ...

_10

INFO[0000] üå± Starting Flow Emulator

_10

INFO[0000] üõ† GRPC server started on 127.0.0.1:3569

_10

INFO[0000] üì° HTTP server started on 127.0.0.1:8080`

## Customizing the Emulator[‚Äã](#customizing-the-emulator "Direct link to Customizing the Emulator")

You can customize the emulator behavior by using flags. Here are some examples:

Change the gRPC and REST API ports:

`_10

flow emulator --port 9000 --rest-port 9001`

Enable persistence of state across restarts:

`_10

flow emulator --persist`

Enable detailed logs for debugging:

`_10

flow emulator --verbose`

For a complete list of available flags, run:

`_10

flow emulator --help`
