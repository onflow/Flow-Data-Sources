# Flow Emulator

The Flow Emulator is a lightweight tool that emulates the behaviour of the real Flow network.

The emulator exposes a gRPC server that implements the Flow Access API,
which is designed to have near feature parity with the real network API.

## Running the emulator with the Flow CLI[‚Äã](#running-the-emulator-with-the-flow-cli "Direct link to Running the emulator with the Flow CLI")

The emulator is bundled with the [Flow CLI](/tools/flow-cli), a command-line interface for working with Flow.

### Installation[‚Äã](#installation "Direct link to Installation")

Follow [these steps](/tools/flow-cli/install) to install the Flow CLI on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

## Usage[‚Äã](#usage "Direct link to Usage")

To learn more about using the Emulator,
