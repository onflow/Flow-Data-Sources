# Add Project Contracts

## Add a Contract[‚Äã](#add-a-contract "Direct link to Add a Contract")

To add a contract to your project, update the `"contracts"` section of your `flow.json` file.

Contracts are specified as key-value pairs, where the key is the contract name,
and the value is the location of the Cadence source code.

For example, the configuration below will register the
contract `Foo` from the `FooContract.cdc` file.

`_10

{

_10

"contracts": {

_10

"Foo": "./cadence/contracts/FooContract.cdc"

_10

}

_10

}`

## Define Contract Deployment Targets[‚Äã](#define-contract-deployment-targets "Direct link to Define Contract Deployment Targets")

Once a contract is added, it can then be assigned to one or more deployment targets.

A deployment target is an account to which the contract will be deployed.
In a typical project, a contract has one deployment target per network (e.g. Emulator, Testnet, Mainnet).

Deployment targets are defined in the `"deployments"` section of your `flow.json` file.

Targets are grouped by their network, where each network is a mapping from target account to contract list.
Multiple contracts can be deployed to the same target account.

For example, here's how we'd deploy contracts `Foo` and `Bar` to the account `my-testnet-account`:

`_11

{

_11

"contracts": {

_11

"Foo": "./cadence/contracts/FooContract.cdc",

_11

"Bar": "./cadence/contracts/BarContract.cdc"

_11

},

_11

"deployments": {

_11

"testnet": {

_11

"my-testnet-account": ["Foo", "Bar"]

_11

}

_11

}

_11

}`
