## Accessing Flow Mainnet[‚Äã](#accessing-flow-mainnet "Direct link to Accessing Flow Mainnet")

The Flow Mainnet is available for access at this URL:

 `_10access.mainnet.nodes.onflow.org:9000`

For example, to access the network using the [Flow Go SDK](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk):

 `_10import "github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk/client"_10_10func main() {_10 flowAccessAddress := "access.mainnet.nodes.onflow.org:9000"_10 flowClient, _ := client.New(flowAccessAddress, grpc.WithInsecure())_10 // ..._10}`
## Account Creation[‚Äã](#account-creation "Direct link to Account Creation")

You can follow the [Flow Port account creation steps](/networks/flow-port) to create a new mainnet account.

## Generating a Non-Custodial Account[‚Äã](#generating-a-non-custodial-account "Direct link to Generating a Non-Custodial Account")

A non-custodial account will make sure you are the only one holding the keys to your account.

You can follow the following steps to add a non-custodial account:

First, generate a new key pair with the [Flow CLI](https://github.com/onflow/flow-cli):

 `_10> flow keys generate --network=mainnet_10_10üî¥Ô∏è Store private key safely and don't share with anyone!_10Private Key 5b438..._10Public Key 1bdc5...`
> **Note**: By default, this command generates an ECDSA key pair on the P-256 curve. Keep in mind the CLI is intended for development purposes only and is not recommended for production use. Handling keys using a Key Management Service is the best practice.

Take a note of the public key and go back to Flow Port. Open the ["Create a new account" page](https://port.onflow.org/transaction?hash=a0a78aa7821144efd5ebb974bb52ba04609ce76c3863af9d45348db93937cf98&showcode=false&weight=1000&halg=3).

On the page, enter your public key from the CLI, ensure the hash algorithm is set to `SHA3_256` and the weight is set to `1000`. Finally, check the box confirming correctness and hit 'Submit'.

> **Important**: Your account needs to have at least 0.002 FLOW for the account creation. More details can be found [in this guide](/build/basics/fees#storage).

Once the transaction is sealed, you should scroll down to the events section and locate the `flow.AccountCreated` event with the newly generated address.

Make sure to take a note of the address. If you want to verify the public key for this address, you can visit [flow-view-source](https://flow-view-source.com/).

## Important Mainnet Smart Contract Addresses[‚Äã](#important-mainnet-smart-contract-addresses "Direct link to Important Mainnet Smart Contract Addresses")

You can review [all available core contracts](/build/core-contracts) deployed to the mainnet to identify which ones you want to import.
