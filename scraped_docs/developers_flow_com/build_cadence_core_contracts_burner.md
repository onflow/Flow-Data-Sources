# Contract

The [Burner](https://github.com/onflow/flow-ft/blob/master/contracts/utility/Burner.cdc) contract provides a way for resources to define
custom logic that is executed when the resource is destroyed.
Resources that want to utilize this functionality should implement
the `Burner.Burnable` interface which requires that they include
a `burnCallback()` function that includes the custom logic.

It is recommended that regardless of the resource, all users and developers
should use `Burner.burn()` when destroying a resource instead of `destroy`.
