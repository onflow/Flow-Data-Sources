# Bridges

Bridges are mechanisms that connect different blockchain networks, enabling secure and decentralized transfers of assets and data across various platforms.

## Celer cBridge[‚Äã](#celer-cbridge "Direct link to Celer cBridge")

[Celer cBridge](https://cbridge.celer.network/) is a decentralized and non-custodial asset bridge that supports more than 150 tokens across over 40 blockchains and layer-2 rollups. It is built on top of the [Celer](https://celer.network/) Inter-chain Message Framework. cBridge has facilitated over $13 billion in cross-chain asset transfer volume across 40+ blockchains for more than 350,000 unique users. It is rapidly growing and expanding to support more blockchains and layer-2 solutions.

## Axelar[‚Äã](#axelar "Direct link to Axelar")

[Axelar](https://www.axelar.network/) is a decentralized cross-chain network connecting over 55 blockchains, facilitating asset transfers and smart contract programmability. It features a proof-of-stake consensus for security and supports cross-chain applications through General Message Passing (GMP). Integrations with platforms like [Squid](https://www.squidrouter.com/) enable easy token swaps across networks like Ethereum and Polygon.
