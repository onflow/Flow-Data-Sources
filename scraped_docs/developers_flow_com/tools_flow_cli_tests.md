# Running Cadence Tests

The Flow CLI provides a straightforward command to execute Cadence tests, enabling developers to validate their scripts and smart contracts effectively.

To run all tests in your project, simply use:

 `_10flow test`

The `flow test` command automatically discovers and runs all test scripts in your project that end with `_test.cdc`.

> **Note:** The `test` command requires a properly initialized configuration. If you haven‚Äôt set up your Flow project yet, refer to the [flow init](/tools/flow-cli/flow.json/initialize-configuration) guide for assistance.

## Prerequisites[‚Äã](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

Before running your tests, ensure that your contracts are properly configured in your `flow.json` file, including any necessary testing aliases.

### Setting Up Testing Aliases in Contracts[‚Äã](#setting-up-testing-aliases-in-contracts "Direct link to Setting Up Testing Aliases in Contracts")

If your tests involve deploying or interacting with contracts, you need to add your contracts to the `contracts` section in the `flow.json` configuration file. Specifically, include the contract name, source location, and an address alias for the `testing` environment.

Example `flow.json` configuration:

 `_19{_19 "contracts": {_19 "Counter": {_19 "source": "cadence/contracts/Counter.cdc",_19 "aliases": {_19 "testing": "0x0000000000000007"_19 }_19 }_19 },_19 "networks": {_19 // ... your network configurations_19 },_19 "accounts": {_19 // ... your account configurations_19 },_19 "deployments": {_19 // ... your deployment configurations_19 }_19}`

For the `testing` alias, you can use one of the following addresses:

* `0x0000000000000005`
* `0x0000000000000006`
* `0x0000000000000007`
* `0x0000000000000008`
* `0x0000000000000009`
* `0x000000000000000A`
* `0x000000000000000B`
* `0x000000000000000C`
* `0x000000000000000D`
* `0x000000000000000E`

> **Note**: For more information on setting up contracts and aliases, refer to the [Flow CLI Configuration](/tools/flow-cli/flow.json/initialize-configuration) documentation.

## Example Usage[‚Äã](#example-usage "Direct link to Example Usage")

Assuming you have a test script named `test_script_test.cdc` in your project directory, which verifies the functionality of a Cadence script executed in the testing environment:

 `_16// test_script_test.cdc_16import Test_16_16access(all) let blockchain = Test.newEmulatorBlockchain()_16_16access(all) fun testSumOfTwo() {_16 let scriptResult = blockchain.executeScript(_16 "access(all) fun main(a: Int, b: Int): Int { return a + b }",_16 [2, 3]_16 )_16_16 Test.expect(scriptResult, Test.beSucceeded())_16_16 let sum = scriptResult.returnValue! as! Int_16 Test.assertEqual(5, sum)_16}`

This script defines a single test case, `testSumOfTwo`, which checks if a Cadence script that adds two integers `(a + b)` works as expected. The test passes if the result matches the expected value of `5`.

You can run all tests in your project using the CLI:

 `_10$ flow test`

The Flow CLI will discover all test scripts ending with `_test.cdc` and execute them. The results will be displayed in the terminal:

 `_10Test results:_10- PASS: test_script_test.cdc > testSumOfTwo`

To learn more about writing tests in Cadence, visit the [Cadence Testing Framework](/build/smart-contracts/testing) documentation.

### Running Specific Tests[‚Äã](#running-specific-tests "Direct link to Running Specific Tests")

If you wish to run a specific test script rather than all tests, you can provide the path to the test file:

 `_10flow test path/to/your/test_script_test.cdc`

This will execute only the tests contained in the specified file.

---

## Flags[‚Äã](#flags "Direct link to Flags")

The `flow test` command supports several flags that provide additional functionality for managing test execution and coverage reporting.

### **Coverage Report**[‚Äã](#coverage-report "Direct link to coverage-report")

* **Flag:** `--cover`
* **Default:** `false`

The `--cover` flag calculates the coverage of the code being tested, helping you identify untested parts of your scripts and contracts.

 `_10$ flow test --cover`

Sample output:

 `_10Test results:_10- PASS: test_script_test.cdc > testSumOfTwo_10Coverage: 96.5% of statements`

---

### Coverage Report Output File[‚Äã](#coverage-report-output-file "Direct link to Coverage Report Output File")

* **Flag:** `--coverprofile`
* **Valid Inputs:** A valid filename with extension `.json` or `.lcov`
* **Default:** `"coverage.json"`

Use the `--coverprofile` flag to specify the output file for the coverage report.

Example:

 `_10$ flow test --cover --coverprofile="coverage.lcov"`

The generated coverage file can then be inspected:

 `_10$ cat coverage.lcov`
### Coverage Code Type[‚Äã](#coverage-code-type "Direct link to Coverage Code Type")

* **Flag:** `--covercode`
* **Valid Inputs:** `"all"` (default) or `"contracts"`
* **Default:** `"all"`

The `--covercode` flag lets you limit the coverage report to specific types of code. Setting the value to `"contracts"` excludes scripts and transactions from the coverage analysis.

 `_10$ flow test --cover --covercode="contracts"`

Sample output when no contracts are present:

 `_10Test results:_10- PASS: test_script_test.cdc > testSumOfTwo_10There are no statements to cover`
> **Note:** In this example, the coverage report is empty because the `--covercode` flag is set to `"contracts"`, and the test script only contains scripts, not contracts.

### Random Execution of Test Cases[‚Äã](#random-execution-of-test-cases "Direct link to Random Execution of Test Cases")

* **Flag:** `--random`
* **Default:** `false`

Use the `--random` flag to execute test cases in a random order. This can help identify issues that may arise due to test dependencies or the order in which tests are run.

 `_10flow test --random`
### Seed for Random Execution[‚Äã](#seed-for-random-execution "Direct link to Seed for Random Execution")

* **Flag:** `--seed`
* **Default:** `0`

Use the `--seed` flag to specify a seed value for the random execution order of test cases. This allows you to reproduce a specific random order by using the same seed value, which is helpful for debugging flaky tests.

 `_10flow test --seed=12345`
> **Note:** If both `--random` and `--seed` are provided, the `--random` flag will be ignored, and the seed value from `--seed` will be used for randomization.

---

### Run Specific Test by Name[‚Äã](#run-specific-test-by-name "Direct link to Run Specific Test by Name")

* **Flag:** `--name`
* **Default:** `""` (empty string)

Use the `--name` flag to run only tests that match the given name. This is useful when you want to execute a specific test function within your test scripts.

 `_10flow test --name=testSumOfTwo`

This command will run only the test function named `testSumOfTwo` across all test scripts that contain it.

To dive deeper into testing the functionality of your Cadence scripts and contracts, explore the [Cadence Testing Framework](https://cadence-lang.org/docs/testing-framework) documentation.
