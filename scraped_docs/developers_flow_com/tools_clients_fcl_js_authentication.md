# Authentication

Authentication in FCL is closely tied to the concept of `currentUser`. In fact, `fcl.authenticate` and `fcl.unauthenticate` are simply aliases for `fcl.currentUser.authenticate()` and `fcl.currentUser.unauthenticate()`, respectively. So, let‚Äôs take a closer look at `currentUser`.

As an onchain app developer using FCL, the primary authentication functionalities revolve around:

* Determining the `currentUser` and whether they are logged in.
* Logging a user in.
* Logging a user out.

Due to the way FCL works, logging in and signing up are essentially the same process.

# Retrieving Information About the Current User

FCL provides two ways to get information about the current user:

1. **A promise-based method** that returns a snapshot of the user‚Äôs data.
2. **A subscription-based method** that triggers a callback function with the latest user information whenever it changes.

### Snapshot of the Current User[‚Äã](#snapshot-of-the-current-user "Direct link to Snapshot of the Current User")

`_10

import * as fcl from "@onflow/fcl"

_10

_10

const currentUser = await fcl.currentUser.snapshot()

_10

console.log("The Current User:", currentUser)`

### Subscribe to the Current User[‚Äã](#subscribe-to-the-current-user "Direct link to Subscribe to the Current User")

`_10

import * as fcl from "@onflow/fcl"

_10

_10

// Returns an unsubscribe function

_10

const unsubscribe = fcl.currentUser.subscribe(currentUser => {

_10

console.log("The Current User:", currentUser)

_10

})`

# Authenticating and Unauthenticating

The TL;DR: Call `fcl.authenticate()` to log in and `fcl.unauthenticate()` to log out.

On Flow mainnet, no additional configuration is needed‚Äîyour app‚Äôs users will go through the authentication process and be able to use any FCL-compatible wallet provider.

During development, you‚Äôll likely want to configure your app to use [`@onflow/dev-wallet`](https://github.com/onflow/fcl-dev-wallet). The [Quick Start](/build/getting-started/fcl-quickstart) guide will walk you through setting it up.

We also recommend using the [FCL Discovery Service](/tools/clients/fcl-js/discovery) to help users discover and connect to FCL-compatible wallets.

Whether you're new to building onchain, or an established veteran, we‚Äôre here to help. If you run into any issues, reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/flow) ‚Äî we‚Äôre happy to assist!
