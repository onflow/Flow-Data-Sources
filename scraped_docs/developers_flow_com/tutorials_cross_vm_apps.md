# Cross-VM App Tutorials

This series covers how to build cross-VM applications that integrate Flow EVM with Flow Cadence, unlocking new capabilities by combining both environments.

## Tutorials[‚Äã](#tutorials "Direct link to Tutorials")

* **[Batched Transactions](/tutorials/cross-vm-apps/introduction)** - Learn how to use FCL with wagmi and RainbowKit to create a cross-VM app.
* **[Add Flow Cadence to Your wagmi App](/tutorials/cross-vm-apps/add-to-wagmi)** - Learn how to integrate Flow Cadence with your existing wagmi/RainbowKit application to enable batch transactions and other Cadence features.
* **[Interacting with COAs](/tutorials/cross-vm-apps/interacting-with-coa)** - Learn how to create and interact with Cadence Owned Accounts (COAs) to control EVM accounts from Cadence.
* **[Batched EVM Transactions](/tutorials/cross-vm-apps/batched-evm-transactions)** - Discover how to batch multiple EVM transactions into a single Cadence transaction.
* **[Cross-VM Bridge](/tutorials/cross-vm-apps/vm-bridge)** - Explore how to bridge fungible and non-fungible tokens between Cadence and EVM environments.
