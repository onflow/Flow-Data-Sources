# Query Epoch Info with Scripts or Events

## Introduction[​](#introduction "Direct link to Introduction")

The epoch contract stores a lot of different state, and the state is constantly changing.
As an external party, there are two ways to keep track of these state changes.
You can either use Cadence scripts to query the state of the contract at any given time,
or you can monitor events that are emitted by the epoch contract to be notified of any important occurrences.

## Monitor Epoch Service Events[​](#monitor-epoch-service-events "Direct link to Monitor Epoch Service Events")

These events can be queried using the Go or JavaScript SDKs to extract useful notifications and information about the
state of the epoch preparation protocol.

### What is a Service Event?[​](#what-is-a-service-event "Direct link to What is a Service Event?")

Service events are special messages that are generated by smart contracts and included in execution results.
They enable communication between system smart contracts and the Flow protocol.
In other words, they serve as a communication mechanism between the execution state and the protocol state.

Concretely, service events are defined and emitted as events like any other in Cadence. An event is considered a service event when it is:

* emitted within the service chunk
* emitted from a smart contract deployed to the service account
* conformant to an event allowlist

Each block contains a system chunk. For each system chunk,
all service events emitted are included in the corresponding execution result.

When verifying the system chunk, verifier nodes will only produce result approvals
when the system chunks included in the execution result are correct.
Thus, the security of this communication mechanism is enforced by the verification system.

When sealing a block containing a service event, the consensus committee will update the protocol state accordingly,
depending on the semantics of the event.

For example, a service event may indicate that a node's stake has diminished to the point where they should be ejected,
in which case the consensus committee would mark that node as ejected in the protocol state.

Service events are fundamentally asynchronous, due the lag between block execution and sealing.
Consequently they are handled slightly differently than other protocol state updates.

The diagram below illustrates the steps each service event goes through to be included in the protocol state.

![Flow Service Event Diagram](/assets/images/epoch-service-event-diagram-7271210f0c98883d51d78681f01a5b6a.png)

For conciseness, we say a service event is `sealed` when the block in which it was emitted is sealed,
and we say a service event is `finalized` when the block containing the seal is finalized.

### Event Descriptions[​](#event-descriptions "Direct link to Event Descriptions")

#### `FlowEpoch.EpochStart`[​](#flowepochepochstart "Direct link to flowepochepochstart")

The Epoch Start service event is emitted by `FlowEpoch.startNewEpoch()`
when the epoch commit phase ends and the Epoch Smart Contracts transition
to the staking auction phase.
It contains the relevant metadata for the new epoch that was generated during the last epoch:

`_24

access(all) event EpochStart (

_24

_24

/// The counter for the current epoch that is beginning

_24

counter: UInt64,

_24

_24

/// The first view (inclusive) of the current epoch.

_24

firstView: UInt64,

_24

_24

/// The last view (inclusive) of the current epoch's staking auction.

_24

stakingAuctionEndView: UInt64,

_24

_24

/// The last view (inclusive) of the current epoch.

_24

finalView: UInt64,

_24

_24

/// Total FLOW staked by all nodes and delegators for the current epoch.

_24

totalStaked: UFix64,

_24

_24

/// Total supply of all FLOW for the current epoch

_24

/// Includes the rewards that will be paid for the previous epoch

_24

totalFlowSupply: UFix64,

_24

_24

/// The total rewards that will be paid out at the end of the current epoch.

_24

totalRewards: UFix64,

_24

)`

#### `FlowEpoch.EpochSetup`[​](#flowepochepochsetup "Direct link to flowepochepochsetup")

The Epoch Setup service event is emitted by `FlowEpoch.startEpochSetup()`
when the staking auction phase ends and the Epoch Smart Contracts transition to the Epoch Setup phase.
It contains the finalized identity table for the upcoming epoch,
as well as timing information for phase changes.

`_35

access(all) event EpochSetup (

_35

_35

/// The counter for the upcoming epoch. Must be one greater than the

_35

/// counter for the current epoch.

_35

counter: UInt64,

_35

_35

/// Identity table for the upcoming epoch with all node information.

_35

/// Includes:

_35

/// nodeID, staking key, networking key, networking address, role,

_35

/// staking information, weight, and more.

_35

nodeInfo: [FlowIDTableStaking.NodeInfo],

_35

_35

/// The first view (inclusive) of the upcoming epoch.

_35

firstView: UInt64,

_35

_35

/// The last view (inclusive) of the upcoming epoch.

_35

finalView: UInt64,

_35

_35

/// The cluster assignment for the upcoming epoch. Each element in the list

_35

/// represents one cluster and contains all the node IDs assigned to that

_35

/// cluster, with their weights and votes

_35

collectorClusters: [FlowClusterQC.Cluster],

_35

_35

/// The source of randomness to seed the leader selection algorithm with

_35

/// for the upcoming epoch.

_35

randomSource: String,

_35

_35

/// The deadlines of each phase in the DKG protocol to be completed in the upcoming

_35

/// EpochSetup phase. Deadlines are specified in terms of a consensus view number.

_35

/// When a DKG participant observes a finalized and sealed block with view greater

_35

/// than the given deadline, it can safely transition to the next phase.

_35

DKGPhase1FinalView: UInt64,

_35

DKGPhase2FinalView: UInt64,

_35

DKGPhase3FinalView: UInt64

_35

)`

#### `FlowEpoch.EpochCommit`[​](#flowepochepochcommit "Direct link to flowepochepochcommit")

The `EpochCommit` service event is emitted when the Epoch Smart Contracts transition
from the Epoch Setup phase to the Epoch Commit phase.
It is emitted only when all preparation for the upcoming epoch (QC and DKG) has been completed.

`_16

access(all) event EpochCommit (

_16

_16

/// The counter for the upcoming epoch. Must be equal to the counter in the

_16

/// previous EpochSetup event.

_16

counter: UInt64,

_16

_16

/// The result of the QC aggregation process. Each element contains

_16

/// all the nodes and votes received for a particular cluster

_16

/// QC stands for quorum certificate that each cluster generates.

_16

clusterQCs: [FlowClusterQC.ClusterQC],

_16

_16

/// The resulting public keys from the DKG process, encoded as by the flow-go

_16

/// crypto library, then hex-encoded.

_16

/// Group public key is the first element, followed by the individual keys

_16

dkgPubKeys: [String],

_16

)`

## Query Information with Scripts[​](#query-information-with-scripts "Direct link to Query Information with Scripts")

The `FlowEpoch` smart contract stores important metadata about the current, proposed,
and previous epochs. Metadata for all historical epochs is stored permanently
in the Epoch Smart Contract's storage.

`_38

access(all) struct EpochMetadata {

_38

_38

/// The identifier for the epoch

_38

access(all) let counter: UInt64

_38

_38

/// The seed used for generating the epoch setup

_38

access(all) let seed: String

_38

_38

/// The first view of this epoch

_38

access(all) let startView: UInt64

_38

_38

/// The last view of this epoch

_38

access(all) let endView: UInt64

_38

_38

/// The last view of the staking auction

_38

access(all) let stakingEndView: UInt64

_38

_38

/// The total rewards that are paid out for the epoch

_38

access(all) var totalRewards: UFix64

_38

_38

/// The reward amounts that are paid to each individual node and its delegators

_38

access(all) var rewardAmounts: [FlowIDTableStaking.RewardsBreakdown]

_38

_38

/// Tracks if rewards have been paid for this epoch

_38

access(all) var rewardsPaid: Bool

_38

_38

/// The organization of collector node IDs into clusters

_38

/// determined by a round robin sorting algorithm

_38

access(all) let collectorClusters: [FlowClusterQC.Cluster]

_38

_38

/// The Quorum Certificates from the ClusterQC contract

_38

access(all) var clusterQCs: [FlowClusterQC.ClusterQC]

_38

_38

/// The public keys associated with the Distributed Key Generation

_38

/// process that consensus nodes participate in

_38

/// Group key is the last element at index: length - 1

_38

access(all) var dkgKeys: [String]

_38

}`

#### Get Epoch Metadata[​](#get-epoch-metadata "Direct link to Get Epoch Metadata")

The `FlowEpoch` smart contract provides a public function, `FlowEpoch.getEpochMetadata()`
to query the metadata for a particular epoch.

You can use the **Get Epoch Metadata**([EP.01](/build/core-contracts/epoch-contract-reference#getting-epoch-info)) script
with the following arguments:

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **epochCounter** | `UInt64` | The counter of the epoch to get metadata for. |

#### Get Configurable Metadata[​](#get-configurable-metadata "Direct link to Get Configurable Metadata")

The `FlowEpoch` smart contract also has a set of metadata that is configurable by the admin
for phase lengths, number of collector clusters, and inflation percentage.

`_17

access(all) struct Config {

_17

/// The number of views in an entire epoch

_17

access(all) var numViewsInEpoch: UInt64

_17

_17

/// The number of views in the staking auction

_17

access(all) var numViewsInStakingAuction: UInt64

_17

_17

/// The number of views in each dkg phase

_17

access(all) var numViewsInDKGPhase: UInt64

_17

_17

/// The number of collector clusters in each epoch

_17

access(all) var numCollectorClusters: UInt16

_17

_17

/// Tracks the annualized percentage of FLOW total supply that is minted as rewards at the end of an epoch

_17

/// Calculation for a single epoch would be (totalSupply * FLOWsupplyIncreasePercentage) / 52

_17

access(all) var FLOWsupplyIncreasePercentage: UFix64

_17

}`

You can use the **Get Configurable Metadata**([EP.02](/build/core-contracts/epoch-contract-reference#getting-epoch-info)) script
to get the list of configurable metadata:

This script does not require any arguments.

#### Get Epoch Counter[​](#get-epoch-counter "Direct link to Get Epoch Counter")

The `FlowEpoch` smart contract always tracks the counter of the current epoch.

You can use the **Get Epoch Counter**([EP.03](/build/core-contracts/epoch-contract-reference#getting-epoch-info)) script
to get the current epoch counter.

This script does not require any arguments.

#### Get Epoch Phase[​](#get-epoch-phase "Direct link to Get Epoch Phase")

The `FlowEpoch` smart contract always tracks the active phase of the current epoch.

`_10

access(all) enum EpochPhase: UInt8 {

_10

access(all) case STAKINGAUCTION

_10

access(all) case EPOCHSETUP

_10

access(all) case EPOCHCOMMIT

_10

}`

You can use the **Get Epoch Phase**([EP.04](/build/core-contracts/epoch-contract-reference#getting-epoch-info)) script
to get the current epoch phase.

This script does not require any arguments.
