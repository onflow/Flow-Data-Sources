# Development Tools

The Flow CLI integrates different development tools, which can now be easily started
and managed from a single place.

Currently the CLI supports starting:

* [Flow Development Wallet](https://github.com/onflow/fcl-dev-wallet)

## Flow Development Wallet[‚Äã](#flow-development-wallet "Direct link to Flow Development Wallet")

The Flow Dev Wallet is a mock Flow wallet that simulates the protocols used by FCL to interact with the Flow blockchain on behalf of simulated user accounts.

**Be sure you have the emulator running before starting this command**
*You can start it using the `flow emulator` command*.

 `_10flow dev-wallet`

*‚ö†Ô∏è This project implements an FCL compatible
interface, but should **not** be used as a reference for
building a production grade wallet.*

After starting dev-wallet, you can set your fcl config to use it like below:

 `_10import * as fcl from "@onflow/fcl"_10_10fcl.config()_10 // Point App at Emulator_10 .put("accessNode.api", "http://localhost:8080") _10 // Point FCL at dev-wallet (default port)_10 .put("discovery.wallet", "http://localhost:8701/fcl/authn")`

You can read more about setting up dev-wallet at [Flow Dev Wallet Project](https://github.com/onflow/fcl-dev-wallet)

## Flags[‚Äã](#flags "Direct link to Flags")

### Port[‚Äã](#port "Direct link to Port")

* Flag: `--port`
* Valid inputs: Number
* Default: `8701`

Port on which the dev wallet server will listen on.

### Emulator Host[‚Äã](#emulator-host "Direct link to Emulator Host")

* Flag: `--emulator-host`
* Valid inputs: a hostname
* Default: `http://localhost:8080`

Specifies the host configuration for dev wallet

### Configuration[‚Äã](#configuration "Direct link to Configuration")

* Flag: `--config-path`
* Short Flag: `-f`
* Valid inputs: valid filename

Specify a filename for the configuration files, you can provide multiple configuration
files by using `-f` flag multiple times.

Specify a filename for the configuration files, you can provide multiple configuration
files by using `-f` flag multiple times.

### Version Check[‚Äã](#version-check "Direct link to Version Check")

* Flag: `--skip-version-check`
* Default: `false`

Skip version check during start up to speed up process for slow connections.
