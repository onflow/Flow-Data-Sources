# Capabilities

Cadence supports [capability-based security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security)
through the [object-capability model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-capability_model).

A capability in Cadence is a value that represents the right
to access an object and perform certain operations on it.
A capability specifies *what* can be accessed, and *how* it can be accessed.

Capabilities are unforgeable, transferable, and revocable.

Capabilities can be storage capabilities or account capabilities:

* **Storage capabilities** grant access to [objects in account storage](/docs/language/accounts/storage),
  via [paths](/docs/language/accounts/paths)
* **Account capabilities** grant access to [accounts](/docs/language/accounts/)

Capabilities can be borrowed to get a [reference](/docs/language/references) to the stored object or the account it refers to.

Capabilities have the type `Capability<T: &Any>`.
The type parameter specifies the kind of reference that can be obtained when borrowing the capability.
The type specifies the associated set of access rights through [entitlements](/docs/language/access-control):
the reference type of the capability can be authorized,
which grants the owner of the capability the ability to access the fields and functions of the target
which require the given entitlements.

For example, a capability which has type `Capability<auth(SaveValue) &Account>`
grants access to an account, and allows saving a value into the account.

Each capability has an ID.
The ID is unique **per account/address**.

Capabilities are created and managed through [capability controllers](/docs/language/accounts/capabilities).

Capabilities are structs, so they are copyable.
They can be used (e.g. borrowed) arbitrarily many times, as long as the target capability controller has not been deleted.
