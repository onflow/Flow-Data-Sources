# What do you want to do today?

### Build

Fire up a new app, add blue-chip features such as tokens and NFTs, or supercharge your user experience.

### Grow

Access builder credits, startup support, and connect with the Flow team in weekly office hours.

### Fund

Explore funding opportunities through VCs, grants, and hackathons to bring your project to life.

### Learn

Learn the basics, dive into the Cadence smart contract language, or explore how to keep building on EVM with the advantages of Flow.

## Build

### Getting Started

### Why Flow?

Learn what led Dieter Shirley, Chief Architect of Flow and co-author of the ERC-721 NFT standard to lead the development of a new L1 blockchain.

### A Better Language

Cadence is a resource-oriented programming language that makes it easy to build secure, scalable, and composable applications.

### Flow EVM

The future is here. Deploy your Solidity contracts on Flow to get sub-cent transaction fees, sponsored gas, and the ability to scale to millions of users.

### Hello World

Build and deploy your first contract, connect to it from the frontend, and call your smart contract functions - all in less than 30 minutes.

### Launch a Token

Learn how to launch a fungible token that's stored in your users' vaults directly in their accounts.

### Create an NFT Collection

Create NFT collections that are stored directly in your users' accounts in a way that makes it nearly impossible to lose them.

### Supercharge Your App

### Access Incredible IP

Flow allows you to link wallets together, enabling your apps to use NFTs in a user's embedded wallet from another app.

### VRF - Cadence

VRF is built into Flow at the protocol level to provide secure, verifiable randomness, for free. Learn how to use VRF in Cadence.

### VRF - EVM

VRF is built into Flow at the protocol level to provide secure, verifiable randomness, for free. Learn how to use VRF in EVM.

### Account Abstraction

Learn how to create child accounts that are linked to a parent account, enabling walletless onboarding and much more.

### Batched EVM Transactions

With Cadence + EVM, you can script EVM transactions to execute with one wallet signature, and even script conditional execution.

### Token Interoperability

Move established EVM tokens to Cadence for more powerful contracts, or move Cadence tokens to EVM to take advantage of established markets.

### Tools

### Flow CLI

The Flow Command Line Interface (CLI) is a powerful tool that enables developers to seamlessly interact with the Flow blockchain across various environments.

### Flow Emulator

The Flow Emulator is a local blockchain environment that allows developers to test and develop their applications without the need to deploy to the mainnet or testnet.

### Flow Client Library (FCL)

The Flow Client Library (FCL) JS is a package used to interact with user wallets and the Flow blockchain.

### EVM Tools and Libraries

Most of your favorite EVM tools and libraries are compatible with Flow. Learn how to work with Hardhat, Foundry, Wagmi, and more.

### Other Clients

Additional clients are available for interacting with the Flow blockchain using a number of popular languages, including Go, Python, Ruby, and JavaScript.

## Grow

### 

### Startup Support

Get comprehensive support including technical guidance, marketing resources, and ecosystem connections.

### Builder Credits
