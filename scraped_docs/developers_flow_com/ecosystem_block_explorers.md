# Flow Block Explorers

Block explorers are user-friendly online tools that visually present blockchain data, allowing users to easily navigate transactions, blocks, addresses, and smart contracts while providing real-time insights and transparency.

## Flow Diver[‚Äã](#flow-diver "Direct link to Flow Diver")

[Flowscan](https://flowscan.io/) provides various tools to explore the blockchain, including:

* Blocks
* Transactions
* Contracts
* Network activity (transaction count)
* Transaction cost (gas fee)
* Validators information

### Supported networks:[‚Äã](#supported-networks "Direct link to Supported networks:")

* [Mainnet](https://flowscan.io/)
* [Testnet](https://testnet.flowscan.io/)

## Flow View[‚Äã](#flow-view "Direct link to Flow View")

[Flow View](https://www.flowview.app/) offers comprehensive tools to view accounts' information, including:

* Address, balance, and storage
* Public keys and their weights
* Staking information
* Tokens, collections, and listings
* Deployed smart contracts

### Supported networks:[‚Äã](#supported-networks-1 "Direct link to Supported networks:")

* [Mainnet](https://www.flowview.app/)
* [Testnet](https://testnet.flowview.app/)
* [Emulator (local)](https://emulator.flowview.app/)

## Contract Browser[‚Äã](#contract-browser "Direct link to Contract Browser")

[Contract Browser](https://contractbrowser.com/) provides tools for viewing deployed smart contracts, their dependencies, and dependents. Features include:

* Search, view, and verify smart contract source code
* Detailed smart contract information

[Testnet Contract Browser](https://testnet.contractbrowser.com/) is also available for `Testnet Flow`.

## Flowscan [EVM][‚Äã](#flowscan-evm "Direct link to Flowscan [EVM]")

[Flowscan](https://evm-testnet.flowscan.io/) is based off of the popular Blockscout and provides a user-friendly interface to search for specific EVM transactions, blocks, monitor network health, and track the status of various smart contracts and tokens on for EVM on Flow. Features include:

* Real-Time Data: View live transaction data, blocks, and account activities.
* Search Functionality: Search for specific transactions, blocks, and accounts.
* Smart Contract Analysis: Examine smart contract statuses and interactions.
* Token Tracking: Monitor the creation and transfer of various tokens on the Flow network.

### Supported networks:[‚Äã](#supported-networks-2 "Direct link to Supported networks:")

* [Testnet](https://evm-testnet.flowscan.io/)
* [Mainnet](https://evm.flowscan.io/)
