# Environment Information

## Transaction Information[‚Äã](#transaction-information "Direct link to Transaction Information")

To get the addresses of the signers of a transaction,
use the `address` field of each signing `Account`
that is passed to the transaction's `prepare` phase.

There is currently no API that allows getting other transaction information.
Please let us know if your use-case demands it by request this feature in an issue.

## Block Information[‚Äã](#block-information "Direct link to Block Information")

To get information about a block, the functions `getCurrentBlock` and `getBlock` can be used:

* `_10

  view fun getCurrentBlock(): Block`

  Returns the current block, i.e. the block which contains the currently executed transaction.
* `_10

  view fun getBlock(at: UInt64): Block?`

  Returns the block at the given height.
  If the block exists within the accessible range defined by `flow.DefaultTransactionExpiry - 10` (`590` blocks), it is returned successfully.
  If the block at the given height does not exist or is outside the default transaction expiration range of `590` blocks below the current sealed block, the function returns `nil`.

The `Block` type contains the identifier, height, and timestamp:

`_35

access(all)

_35

struct Block {

_35

/// The ID of the block.

_35

///

_35

/// It is essentially the hash of the block.

_35

///

_35

access(all)

_35

let id: [UInt8; 32]

_35

_35

/// The height of the block.

_35

///

_35

/// If the blockchain is viewed as a tree with the genesis block at the root,

_35

// the height of a node is the number of edges between the node and the genesis block

_35

///

_35

access(all)

_35

let height: UInt64

_35

_35

/// The view of the block.

_35

///

_35

/// It is a detail of the consensus algorithm. It is a monotonically increasing integer

_35

/// and counts rounds in the consensus algorithm. It is reset to zero at each spork.

_35

///

_35

access(all)

_35

let view: UInt64

_35

_35

/// The timestamp of the block.

_35

///

_35

/// Unix timestamp of when the proposer claims it constructed the block.

_35

///

_35

/// NOTE: It is included by the proposer, there are no guarantees on how much the time stamp can deviate from the true time the block was published.

_35

/// Consider observing blocks‚Äô status changes off-chain yourself to get a more reliable value.

_35

///

_35

access(all)

_35

let timestamp: UFix64

_35

}`
